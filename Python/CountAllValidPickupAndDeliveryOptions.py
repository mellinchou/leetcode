# Consider n = 3 orders.

# Now consider one particular sequence; S = [(P1, D1), (P2, D2), (P3, D3)]
# Now let us consider an arrangement like this, where P1 comes before P2 and P2 comes before P3, i.e., P1 ... P2 ... P3 ...
# Now we observe that -

# D3 can only be placed in one position (1 ways), i.e., at the last after P3. So, the sequence becomes - P1 ... P2 ... P3 ... D3 ...
# D2 can be placed at any one of three positions (3 ways), i.e., between P2 and P3, or between P3 and D3, or after D3. So, one of the sequence becomes - P1 ... P2 ... P3 ... D2 ... D3 ...
# D1 can be placed at any one of the above five positions (5 ways).
# So, for the above particular sequence S we have - 1 * 3 * 5 = 15 ways.
# But the sequence can be arranged in 3! ways. So, the ans is 3! * (1 * 3 * 5).

# In general, the ans is - n! * (1 * 3 * 5 * ... * (2*n-1)).
